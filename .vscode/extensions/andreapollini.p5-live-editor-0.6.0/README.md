# p5-live-editor

This extension let you code using p5js without leaving Visual Studio Code.

There are other plugins that le you do the same but all have some troubles, so I decided to "merge" them in order to create a more useful editor for my classroom lessons.

If the current folder contains an index.html and a sketch.js, you can open the preview by clicking on the button in the status bar.
